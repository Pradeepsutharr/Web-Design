    <h2>Adjusant sibling selector</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it
            immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".</li>

            The plus sign (+) is the adjacent sibling combinator, between two paragraph tag (element) selectors. What
            this means is “select any paragraph tag that is directly after another paragraph tag (with nothing in
            between)”. Here’s some examples of what it would select:
        </li>
    </ol>
