    <h2>General Sibling Selector</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The general sibling selector (~) selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.</li>
        <li><strong>Example :-</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="../../Assets/Images/general sibling.png" alt="">
            <br>
            In that example, you would be selecting all paragraphs in an article that come
            after the featured image <br>
            s(an element with a class name of “featured-image”) and making them of slightly
            smaller font-size.</li>
    </ol>
