        <h1>CSS Position</h1>
        <p>The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left
            properties determine the final location of positioned elements.</p>

        <h3>Types of Position</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>position: static;</li>
            <li>position: relative;</li>
            <li>position: absolute;</li>
            <li>position: fixed;</li>
            <li>position: sticky;</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Static</h2>
        <p>Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
        <p>An element with <b>position: static;</b> is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to
            the normal flow of the page:</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <p>An element with <b>position: relative;</b> is positioned relative to its normal position</p>
        <p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
            adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the
            element.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Absolute</h2>
        <p>An element with <b>position: absolute;</b> is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
            positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>
        <p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves
            along with page scrolling.</p>
        <p><b>Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements</b></p>

        <hr>


        <h2>Fixed</h2>
        <p>An element with <b>position: fixed;</b> is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the
            same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position
            the element.</p>
        <p>A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>

        <hr>


        <h2>Sticky</h2>
        <p>A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
            relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like
            position:fixed).
